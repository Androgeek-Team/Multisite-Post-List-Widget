After you installed and activated the plugin on plugins page it appears under Appearance > Widgets.

Find Multisite Posts widget and drag into one of your sidebar.

Here you can give it a title. After you named it you can specify the number of posts. Default 1. If you change to 3 then the widget lists 3 posts per selected blogs.

The Excerpt Length specifies the word count in the displayed excerpt.

If you check in "Display name of the blog on top" then the widget prints out each blog name before the post list.

Now you cen see a list of blogs in the network. If you want to show posts from all block then leave checked in all.

After you selected the blogs, you can specify what field needs to display. Default Title, Content (this is the excerpt) and Featured image.

Hit the save button and you got an awesome post list across the whole network.

For example on Androgeek we have 4 sites.

 - Androgeek (the main page)
 - Code Androgeek (Dev related content)
 - Movie Androgeek (trailers and reviews)
 - Test (plugin demo page)

We put a post list on each site but we don't want to display sample posts from Test. We use this configuration on the main site:

    Title: Androgeek
    Number of Posts Per Site: 2
    Excerpt Length: 55
    [ ] Display name of the blog on top

    Enabled Blogs:
     [ ] androgeek.hu
     [x] code.androgeek.hu
     [x] movie.androgeek.hu
     [ ] test.androgeek.hu

    Fields:
     [x] Title
     [x] Content
     [x] Featured Image
     [ ] Domain Name
     [ ] Blog Name
     [x] Blog Name as Link
     [ ] Author's Name
     [ ] Published At

What does it mean?

We want a widget with title "Androgeek". We would like to displat 2 posts per blog.
We leaved excerpt lenth on default (55) and we don't want to display name of the blogs on top of each section.
We selected 2 blog (skip itseld and test). To display we enabled Title, Content, Featured Image.
And additionaly we enabled Blog Name as Link to display the blog name for each posts.
